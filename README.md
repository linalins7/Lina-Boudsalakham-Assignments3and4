For assignment 3: The Hangman A game is started by starting the program. You can play with words ranging from 6 to 29 characters, in fact the game starts with prompting you to choose the length of the mystery word. Then the program will prompt you to guess the word, letter by letter, but you may always attempt to guess the entire word in one go. At the start and after each guess, the program will display the mystery word, but the characters are hidden as underscores (until they are correctly guessed). No matter the length of the chosen word, you have 11 guesses. Lastly, at the end of the game, the program will prompt you to play again.

For assignment 4: Des chiffres et des lettres In this game, we differentiate between two parts: the letters round and the numbers round. During this first one, the user is asked to choose either a vowel or a consonant. In function of the user's choice, the program will display many letters (with precise number of consonants and vowels that the user chose in the beginning). With these letters, the user has to make the biggest possible word. In the numbers round, 6 numbers are displayed randomly. The user has to compute some operations using the 6 numbers to get the value that is the closest to a random target given by the computer.
